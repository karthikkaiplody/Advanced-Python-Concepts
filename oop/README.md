### Principles of Object Oriented Programming

- Encapsulation
    Restricting the access particular attributes from instance level making them read only
    Making them only access and not modifiable.

- Inheritance
    Reusing the code from parent class across all the child classes.

- Polymorphism
    Refers to many forms. Ability to use the entity( can be functions ) into different types in different times.   
    Handling different kinds of object by a single entity.
    Ex: len()  built in function which works for a string and list too.

- Abstraction
    Only shows the neccessary details and hiding unneccessary details from user.
